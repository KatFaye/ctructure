    <h2 class="text-center">Application Domain</h2>

    <p>Description of the application domain of your choice. State as clearly as possible what you want to do.</p>

    <h2 class="text-center">Usefulness</h2>

    <p>Usefulness. State as clearly as possible why your chosen application is useful. Make sure to answer the following questions: Are there any similar or equivalent web sites/applications out here? If so, what are they and how is yours different?</p>

    <h2 class="text-center">Realness</h2>

    <p>Realness. Describe what your data is and where you will get it.</p>

    <h2 class="text-center">Functionality</h2>

    <p>Description of the functionality that you plan to offer. This is where you talk about how to meet the functionality requirements. There are two types of functions you need to offer:</p>

    <h3 class="text-center">Basic</h3>

    <p>Show how to insert/update/delete records to the database</p>
    <p>Show how to search the database and list or print returned results. You need to show a few different interesting queries over your database. *One of the queries must involve join of multiple tables.*</p>
    <h3 class="text-center">Advanced</h3>

    <p>Remember to include at least two creative things (advanced functions), i.e., something that doesn't exist in equivalent web sites/applications. The advanced functions should go beyond the basic functions listed above; in addition, an advanced function should also be something that is technically challenging, meaning you would need to spend some significant time (at least a few days work) to implement it. Of course, such functions should be relevant and therefore useful for your application. Remember that you have to define a challenging problem at the time of your final demo and show that how you solved it. To have an idea about our expectations, a team of 4 with average programming skill will spend 3-4 days programming each of the advanced functions. It has to have programming involved. this is 3-4 days of useful work so it doesn't include the time spent on learning the material or debugging the code. Please have a look at previous semester's projects to have an idea about expectations.
    </p>
    <p>Make clear what the features are, and explain why you think it is cool to have them. If you are unclear, please check the project overview lecture or talk to TA.</p>
